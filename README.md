# ML_Stutter_Detection
This is a code sample of the stutter detection I developed at a previous company. Because of the success of the model, as well as the nature of the company, one can request to see the rest of the code.

In the code sample are some of the data pre-processing functions I used on the data, to prep it for modelling and analysis.
